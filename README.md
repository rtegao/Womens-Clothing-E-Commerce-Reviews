## Folders Description

- ### EDA

Folder with Exploratory Data Analysis notebook

- ###  BagOfWords

Folder with two notebook, using the Bag of Words approach.

- ### RNN

Developing folder, the approach is carried out through Recurrent Neural Networks.

## Notebooks Description

- ### EDAWomenClothing

Exploratory data analysis notebook, with columns description (kaggle copy) and plots to get a fully understend from the database.

- ### NLPWomenClothing

Nothebook using a basic text preprocessing function and some shallow learning algorithms.

- ### unbalancedLearning

Trying to deal with the imbalance distribution of the target column (Recommended IND). The same text preprocessing function and algorithms from the previous notebook, have been implemented.
Some requirements have been established to choose the best imbalanced rate and algorithm, after this a ensemble learning was implemented to improve the generalization.

- ### RNN_NLP

This notebook it's not completed yet, but the main idea it's to classificate the custumers base on their reviews, using RNN.

 
- # Future Improvements
It's possible to use the "Rating" column as an extra feature to improve the model performance, in a future version, for the Bag of Words and RNN approach.
The RNN approach needs a lot of development, however the basic data preparation it's done, so it's possible to take some benefit there.
